### The idea:

This website is intended to show my abilities in Angular.
The goal is to create a 2-D hockey action game based on NES Hockey.
This will have multiplayer game sessions where users can invite their friends to duel.
Finally, I will be creating a nueral network with a reinforcement model for the AI players.

### The stack:

The front end will be an Angular built with RXJS's timer Observable to keep a 60-tick in-game timer.
The game state and physics engine will then be transferred to the back end with a Socket.Io connection to enable multiplayer.
The back end will be written in Java and I will be using this to learn the Spring framework.
The neural network will also be written in Java, although I know there is much more support and performs better with Python, so I might make a Flask server for that.
