# Arcade Hockey

### The idea:

This website is intended to show my abilities in Angular while learning the .NET framework.
The goal is to create a simple 2-D game based on NES Hockey, that will have multiplayer game sessions where users can invite their friends to duel.

___

### The stack:

The front end will be an Angular built with RXJS's timer Observable to keep a 60-tick in-game timer.
The game state and physics engine will then be transferred to the back end with a Socket.Io connection to enable multiplayer.
The back end will be written in C# and I will be using this to learn the .NET framework.
